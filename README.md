# DACCER

An educational toolkit designed to provide a fast and efficent way to find solutions to the shortest path problem. 

## Getting Started

Assuming you have all the class files , simply run userinterface.py, from here a database will be automatically created allowing for first run users to create log in tools, upon the completeion of the login system the toolkit will automatically allow for valid users to input graphs, or will provide a randomly generated graph if requested. 

A valid start and end node should be selected and the program will display the shortest path through valid nodes in the entered graph.

### Prerequisites

A Python Interpreter is all that is required. 
DBrowser can be used to view the database, please note all senstive information in the database will be encryped.

## Built With

* [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/) - The sql library used for backend database
* [TKInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) - Front end
